# ECE 238 Project: 
# Stage-Wise School Reopening using Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains the code for a project for EE 238 at UCLA. For this project, we introduced RL strategies to optimize lockdowns aned subsequent re-opening in response to COVID-19 within a school setting using OpenAI Gym and PyTorch.
